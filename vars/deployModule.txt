<p>
Deploy content to module.
</p>

<p>
	If <code>deployModule</code> is used in a Job triggered by a non-merge gerrit event, the module's name will be
	postfixed by "_testing" and the version identifier will encode the triggering patch set.
	Testing modules are already purged depending on the given list of `cleanupEvents` (gerrit event types).
	Defaults are <code>["change-merged", "change-abandoned"]</code>.
</p>

<p>
Intended usage:
<pre>
	inSingularity() {
		deployModule([name: "ppu",
	                  source: "install",
	                  cleanupEvents: ["change-merged", "change-abandoned"]])
	}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The content of a source folder and a associated named new modulefile is deployed to specified locations.
The singularity container name is placed in the help message of the module.
</p>

<p>
	<b>returns</b> deployed module including version identifier
